%%%%%%   generate step response with given parameters K, wn and zeta    %%%%%%

% choose some K, wn and zeta

% we can always generate a unit step response using TF defined by K, wn, zeta

%%%%%%    estimate the full step response graph given partial data from figure 1          
%%%%%%    the problem in Lab 5 was, as seen in figure 1, the response was highly 
%%%%%%    oscillatory and when we collected data, we gave a short time window. 
%%%%%%    say in figure 1, we only collected the step response data for a time window 4 sec.

% the question is: is it possible to use the graph between t = 0 and t = 4
% to estimate K, wn and zeta of the 2nd order TF such that we can project
% the step response graph from t = 4 on? if possible, we can concatenate
% the projected graph between t = 4 and t = 20, and the data we already got
% between t = 0 and t = 4; the combination of the two would complete the step
% response of a 2nd order TF, i.e.,
% (partial real data + projection = complete response), then you can call your
% script to calculate Mp, tr, ts.

% use (t1, y1) through (t5, y5) to estimate K, wn and zeta
% the time domain solution of unit response of second order TF
% y(t)=K*(1-1/sqrt(1-zeta^2)*exp(-zeta*wn*t)*sin(wn*sqrt(1-zeta^2)*t+acos(zeta)))
% --- let's say it is eqn.(+)

% denote damped natural frequence as wd = wn*sqrt(1-zeta^2)
% period is the time difference between adjacent peaks, T = 2*pi/wd
Tavg = mean(diff(tSample));
wd = 2*pi/Tavg; % = wn*sqrt(1-zeta^2), so we know wn times some zeta equals a number

% use data points (t1,y1), (t2,y2), (t3,y3)
% denote M = 1/sqrt(1-zeta^2)*exp(-zeta*wn*t1)*sin(wd*t1+acos(zeta))
%        N = exp(-zeta*wn*T)
% by eqn.(+) above, we have
% y1 - y2 = K*M*N - K*M = K*M*(N-1)         --- eqn.(2)
% similarly,
% y1 - y3 = K*M*N^2 - K*M = K*M*(N-1)*(N+1) --- eqn.(3)
% divide eqn.(3) by eqn.(2), we have
% N + 1 = (y1-y3)/(y1-y2)
% so N = (y1-y3)/(y1-y2) - 1                --- eqn.(N cal.)
% note that N by this method, is independent of M, we can repeat this
% using data points (t2,y2), (t3,y3), (t4,y4)
%                   (t3,y3), (t4,y4), (t5,y5) ...
%                   (t(n),y(n)), (t(n+1),y(n+1)), (t(n+2),y(n+2))

N1 = (y1-y3)/(y1-y2) - 1;
N2 = (y2-y4)/(y2-y3) - 1;
N3 = (y3-y5)/(y3-y4) - 1;
Navg = mean([N1 N2 N3]);
% according to the notation of N
% now we have
% zeta*wn = -log(N)/T
% also by notation of wd
% sqrt(1-zeta^2)*wn = 2*pi/T

% solve for wn and zeta by using N and T
% we need to call numerical solver fsolve for a system of nonlinear
% equations
% note: you need Optimisation Toolbox in order to use fsolve
